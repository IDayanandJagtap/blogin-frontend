Creating a blog application : 


essential : 
	authentication 
	db storage 


pages : 
	Home 
	All posts 
	Post ! (to those who have an account ) 
	My posts
	

later : 
	user Dashboard 



features : 
	enabling comments on every single post 
	sharing to social media 


Right now : 
	Store the post ... 
	use state doesn't work because the comoponent gets render when the page is changes ...
	It can be either stored in localStorage or somewhere else ! 
	Or useMemo maybe !
